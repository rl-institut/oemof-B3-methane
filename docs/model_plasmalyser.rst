	Fig. 1: Process of waste water plasmalysis.

In general, plasmalysis is a process in which chemical compounds are broken down using a plasma field
(plasma chemical dissociation). This is followed by the formation of new molecules through the synthesis of two or more elements.

Waste water plasmalysis uses waste water from sewage treatment, biogas or industrial plants. This waste water has a high proportion
of nitrogen and carbon compounds, each of which contains hydrogen (z.B ammonia NH\ :sub:`4`\ ) and thus increases the energy yield.
A high-frequency plasma field with several thousand kilovolts splits the molecules of the waste water into individual C, N, H and O atoms.
The atoms are now present as ionised gas within which they recombine to hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen. The gases can be 
separated with the help of a gas membrane and stored in tanks. As a by-product purified water remains. The hydrogen and carbon dioxide 
can be utilised in biological methanisation. The methan that has already been formed can also stored. The pure nitrogen can be processed 
in the chemical industry.
